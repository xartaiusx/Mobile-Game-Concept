Mobile Game Concept

A Unity-based rhythm-action RPG prototype for mobile, combining class-based combat, enemy AI, loot systems, and modular gameplay architecture. Players choose from unique classes, face waves of enemies and bosses, and collect loot, all while syncing their attacks, dodges, and abilities to the beat of the soundtrack for enhanced effects and combos. The result is fast-paced, music-driven combat that rewards timing, positioning, and precision.

📜 Overview

This project is a mobile-friendly 3D action RPG where rhythm drives the battle flow. Each successful on-beat input increases damage, reduces cooldowns, or triggers bonus effects. The architecture is designed for modularity, enabling easy expansion into a full game or adaptation for other timing-based combat systems.
